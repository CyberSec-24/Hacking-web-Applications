SOAP is a lightweight and simple XML-based protocol designed to exchange structured and type information on the web. 

The XML envelope element is always the root element of a SOAP message in the XML schema. 

SOAP injection includes special characters such as single quotes, double quotes, semicolons, and so on.

The attacker injects malicious query strings in the user input field to bypass web service authentication mechanisms and access backend databases. 

This attack works similarly to SQL injection attacks
