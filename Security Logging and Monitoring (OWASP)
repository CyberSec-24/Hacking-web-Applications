Web applications maintain logs to track usage patterns, such as user and admin login credentials.

Security logging and monitoring failures cover application weaknesses such as insufficient logging, improper output neutralization for logs, exclusion of security-relevant Information, and addition of sensitive information to log files

Insufficient logging and monitoring refer to scenarios in which the detection software either fails to record a malicious event or ignores important details about the event. 

Attackers usually inject, delete, or tamper with web application logs to engage in malicious activities or hide their identities.

Insufficient logging and monitoring make the detection of malicious attempts of the attacker difficult, and the attacker can perform malicious attacks such as password brute-forcing to steal confidential passwords

 Logs that do not provide information about overall logins, failed login attempts, and important transactions

Inappropriate monitoring of applications and API logs.

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools such as OWASP ZAP that fail to generate alerts.

Web applications that are not capable of detecting, escalating, or issuing alerts of suspicious activities in real time
