A Magecart attack, also referred to as web skimming, involves an attacker inserting malicious code into a target website to collect sensitive customer data, such as credit card details, usernames, addresses, and other personal information, during an online transaction. 

These stolen details are further used for credit card fraud, identity theft, or can be sold on the dark web to make fraudulent purchases.

Steps Include:-
▪ Step 1 Attacker identifies an e-commerce website with outdated software or third-party plugins to gain illegitimate access.
▪ Step 2: After gaining access, the attacker embeds malicious JS into the website. 
▪ Step 3: The injected script is activated during the users’ checkout process, exfiltrating their card details to the attacker's server or controlled domain.
▪ Step 4: The attacker obtains users’ card details and uses them for malicious purposes.
