Same-site attacks, also known as related-domain attacks, occur when an attacker targets a subdomain of a trusted organization and attempts to redirect users to an attacker-controlled web page. 

Subdomains that are misconfigured or left for years without use are often targeted by attackers to perform this attack.

Generally, the most familiar domains such as .edu, .com, and .org contain several perimeters that make it easy for attackers to capture unused or misconfigured subdomains sharing the legitimate siteâ€™s top-level domains (TLDs). 

These TLDs help attackers in hijacking the legitimate websites to create dangling records using extended TLDs (eTLDs). 

Such websites sharing the same eTLD+1 domain are called same sites, which can be targeted by same-site attackers.

The victims of these attacks are redirected to an attacker-controlled web page, which has the appearance of a secure, legitimate web page.

The vulnerable subdomains can be compromised through phishing attacks, malware injection, cookie poisoning, abuse of JavaScript APIs, etc. 

Same-site attackers can also obtain cookies because similar sites that use the eTLD+1 domain share cookies.

In a Same-site attack, the attacker redirects a user attempting to browse www.certifiedhacker.com to an attacker-controlled dangling site, rans.certifiedhacker.com. 
The malicious link shares a common domain name, which lures the user into believing that the redirected site is the secure or legitimate one
