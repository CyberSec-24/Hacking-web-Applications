Web applications need to store sensitive information such as passwords, credit-card numbers, account records, and other authentication information in a database or on a file system. 

If users do not maintain the proper security of their storage locations, the application may be at risk as attackers can access the storage and misuse the information

Many web applications do not properly protect their sensitive data from unauthorized users.

Sensitive data exposure occurs because of flaws such as insecure cryptographic storage and information leakage.

 When an application uses poorly written encryption code to encrypt and store sensitive data in a database, 

the attacker can easily exploit this flaw to steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data such as credit-cards numbers, SSNs, and other authentication credentials. 

Thus, they can launch further attacks such as identity theft and credit-card fraud.

f these keys are stored at insecure locations, then attackers can retrieve them easily and decrypt the sensitive data. 


The insecure storage of keys, certificates, and passwords also allows the attacker to gain access to the web application as a legitimate user. 

Furthermore, developers must check the randomness of the initialization vectors (IVs) used in the encryption algorithms. 

Developers should ensure that the IVs are not reused and are generated using secure cipher modes of operation
