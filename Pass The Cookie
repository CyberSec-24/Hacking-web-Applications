Pass-the-cookie attacks allow attackers to access a user’s web services without providing any identity or performing multi-factor authentication. 

A pass-the-cookie attack occurs when attackers obtain a clone of a cookie from the user’s browser and uses the cookie to establish a session with the target web server.

If attackers can retrieve appropriate cookies, they may log in as a valid entity to previously accessed web services, evading all the authentication checkpoints. 

Attackers may also use a specifically developed program or a phishing attack to obtain these cookies.

Mozilla Firefox saves all cookies inside a local SQLite database that attackers may acquire using tools such as firefox_creds. 

If the captured cookie is a session cookie, the attacker can use malware to implant their own session while browsing the web application. 

Attackers can also use mimikatz to extract encrypted cookies
