In a watering hole attack, the attacker identifies the kind of websites frequently surfed by a target company/individual and tests these websites to identify any possible vulnerabilities. 

Once the attacker identifies the vulnerabilities, he/she injects a malicious script/code into the web application that can redirect the web page and download malware onto the victimâ€™s machine. 

After infecting the vulnerable web application, the attacker waits for the victim to access the infected web application. 

This attack is called a watering hole attack, as the attacker waits for the victim to fall into the trap, similar to a lion waiting for its prey to arrive at a watering hole to drink water.

When the victim surfs the infected website, the web page redirects him/her and downloads malware onto his/her machine, compromising the machine and indeed compromising the network/organization
