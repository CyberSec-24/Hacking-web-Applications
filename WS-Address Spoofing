WS-Address provides additional routing information in the SOAP header to support asynchronous communication. 

This technique allows the transmission of web service requests and response messages using different TCP connections. 

It is essential for long-running service requests where the calculation time of the server-side application exceeds the lifetime of a single TCP connection

 As the requester selects the endpoint address used in the ReplyTo and FaultTo headers, it is not secured properly against tampering by intermediaries. 

Although the specification asks to perform digital signatures on these header fields, the values mostly depend on the default setting without any proper security.

This causes a vulnerability that can be exploited by the attacker to perform the WS-Address spoofing attack.

In the WS-address spoofing attack, an attacker sends a SOAP message containing fake WS-Address information to the server. 

The <ReplyTo> header consists of the address of the endpoint selected by the attacker instead of the web service client. 

The endpoint selected by the attacker receives unnecessary traffic via SOAP messages

The attacker may generate a massive amount of traffic, thus resulting in a DoS attack. 

Attackers use tools such as WS-Attacker to identify and exploit WS-addressing spoofing vulnerabilities.
