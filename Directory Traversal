Complex applications are configured with multiple directories that exist as application components and data. 

An application can traverse these directories to locate and execute the legitimate portions of an application. 

A directory traversal/forceful browsing attack occurs when the attacker is able to browse the directories and files outside the normal application access. 

Such an attack exposes the directory structure of an application and often the underlying web server and operating system.

Directory traversal allows attackers to access restricted directories, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files, and execute commands outside the web server's root directory

Enumerate the contents of files and directories 

Access pages that otherwise require authentication (and possibly payment) 

Gain secret knowledge of the application and its construction 

Discover user IDs and passwords stored in hidden files
