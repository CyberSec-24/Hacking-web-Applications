Components such as libraries and frameworks that are used in most web applications always execute with full privileges, and flaws in any component can have severe consequences. 

Attackers can identify weak components or dependencies by scanning or by performing manual analysis. 

Attackers search for any vulnerabilities on exploit sites such as Exploit Database (https://www.exploit-db.com), CXSecurity (https://cxsecurity.com), and Zero Day Initiative (https://www.zerodayinitiative.com).

If a vulnerable component is identified, the attacker customizes the exploit as required and executes the attack. 

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to cause serious data loss or take over control of the servers

When all the componentsâ€™ versions from both the server and client sides remain unknown. This can include nested dependencies as well as components that are being used directly.

When the regular vulnerability scanning process is neglected and not subscribed to the security updates associated with the components being used

When the compatibility of software updates or patches is not properly validated or checked.
