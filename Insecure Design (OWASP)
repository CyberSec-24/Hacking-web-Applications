Insecure design flaws arise in an application because of the improper implementation of security controls and can lead to crucial vulnerabilities such as SQLi and Open S3 buckets.

Application designers may overlook security threats or have mediocre knowledge about them; this is a major cause of these vulnerabilities. 

Such vulnerabilities can directly compromise the application’s security. 

Attackers initiate the threat modeling of an application’s working process to identify a wide range of flaws and loopholes before exploiting an insecure design or architecture

Attackers often attempt to exploit poorly implemented APIs, which fail to filter requests properly. 

They search for weak APIs that are not integrated with security gateways to differentiate malicious inputs. Then, they attach malicious code to a vulnerable API. 

When a user accesses that API via an application, the malicious code loads along with the database content on the user’s browser
