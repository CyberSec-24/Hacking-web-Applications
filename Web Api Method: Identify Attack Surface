After identifying the target API to attack and its security implementations, an attacker needs to identify the attack surface for launching the attack. 

It is very easy to find an attack surface for UI-based applications, as we can see various input fields on the web pages. 

However, identifying the attack surface for an API is different as there are no built-in UI fields; we can only see an API endpoint. 

API metadata reveals a large amount of technical information such as paths, parameters, and message formats, which is useful for performing an attack. 

REST API uses metadata formats such as Swagger, RAML, API-Blueprint, and I/O Docs, while SOAP API uses WSDL/XML-Schema, etc

If an API does not have metadata, attackers monitor and record the communication between the API and an existing client to identify the initial attack surface. 

For example, an attacker may use a mobile app that uses target the API, configure a local proxy for recording traffic, and finally configure the mobile device to use this proxy to access the API

Postman allows attackers to capture API traffic, including requests, responses, and cookies, using a built-in proxy. 

Postman interceptor can catch requests and responses, and Postmanâ€™s proxy runs inside the Postman application and can be used with HTTP or HTTPS websites
