HTTP: APIs such as SOAP and REST mostly use the HTTP protocol for communicating API-based messages. 

The HTTP protocol is a text-based protocol where the header information is transmitted in a readable format. 

For example, consider the following HTTP Request and Response headers


 Message Formats: The API messages transmitted over the web will take some format such as JSON for REST API and XML for SOAP API. 

If these formats are used incorrectly, they can pave the way for vulnerabilities.

As these formats are easy to understand, an attacker can easily manipulate messages encoded in these formats to identify the target and its perimeter.
