Attackers carry out hidden field manipulation attacks against e-commerce websites, as most of these sites have hidden fields in their price and discount specifications.

In every client session, developers use hidden fields to store client information, including product prices and discount rates.

During the development of such programs, developers feel that all their applications are safe; however, hackers can manipulate the product prices and even complete transactions with the altered prices.

When a user makes selections on an HTML page, the selection is typically stored as form field values and sent to the application as an HTTP request (GET or POST). 

HTML can also store field values as hidden fields, which are not rendered on the screen by the browser but collected and submitted as parameters during form submissions.

Attackers can examine the HTML code of the page and change the hidden field values to change post requests to the server
