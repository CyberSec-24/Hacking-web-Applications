A clickjacking attack is performed when the target website is loaded into an iframe element that is masked with a web page element that appears legitimate. 

The attacker performs this attack by tricking the victim into clicking on any malicious web page element that is placed transparently on the top of any trusted web page.

They perform such attacks by exploiting the vulnerabilities caused by HTML iframes or improper configuration of the X-Frame-Options header. 

There are several variations of clickjacking attacks such as likejacking and cursorjacking. 

To perform these attacks, attackers send a link to the malicious website to the victim through email, social media, or any other media.

In clickjacking, the attacker loads the target website inside a low opacity iframe.

Then, the attacker designs a page such that all the clickable items such as buttons are positioned exactly as on the selected target website.

Now, the victim is tricked into clicking on the invisible controls or the deceptive UI elements that automatically trigger various malicious actions such as injecting malware,
retrieving malicious web pages, retrieving sensitive information such as credit card details, transferring money from the victim’s account, and buying products online.

Hidden overlay: In this technique, the attacker creates an iframe of 1×1 pixels containing malicious content placed secretly under the mouse cursor. 
When the user clicks on this cursor, it will be registered on the malicious page although the malicious content is concealed by the cursor
