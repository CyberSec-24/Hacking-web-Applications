Similar to the way in which a user interacts with a web application through a browser,a web service can interact directly with the web application without the need for an interactive user session or a browser.

The evolution and increasing use of web services in businesses offer new attack vectors in an application framework. 

Web services are based on XML protocols such as Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) for describing the connection points, Universal Description, Discovery, 

Integration (UDDI) for the description and discovery of web services, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) for communication between web services, which are vulnerable to various web application threats.

Thus, web services provide the attacker with much of the information required to fingerprint the environment to formulate an attack. 
Some examples of this type of attack are as follows:
1. An attacker injects a malicious script into a web service and can disclose and modify application data.
2. An attacker uses a web service for ordering products and injects a script to reset the quantity and status on the confirmation page to less than what he or she had originally ordered. 
Thus, the system processing the order request submits the order, ships the order, and then modifies the order to show that the company is shipping a smaller number of products, but the attacker ends up receiving more of the product than he or she pays for
