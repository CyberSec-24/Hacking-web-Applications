Web applications sometimes use XML to store data such as user credentials in XML documents; attackers can parse and view such data using XPATH. 

XPATH defines the flow of the document and verifies user credentials, such as the username and password, to redirect them to a specific user account

Attackers identify the XPATH and insert an XML injection or XML schema to bypass the authentication process and gain unrestricted access to the data stored in XML. 

The process by which attackers enter values that query XML takes advantage of is an XML injection attack. 

Attackers inject XML data and tags into user input fields to manipulate XML schema or populate XML databases with bogus entries.
