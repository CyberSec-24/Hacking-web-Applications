WSDL files are automated documents consisting of sensitive information about service ports, connections formed between two electronic machines, and so on. 

Attackers can use WSDL probing attacks to obtain information about the vulnerabilities in public and private web services, as well as to perform an SQL attack

A web service probing attack involves the following steps:

▪ In the first step, trap the WSDL document from web service traffic and analyze it to determine the purpose of the application, functional breakdown, entry points, and message types

▪ Create a set of valid requests by selecting a set of operations and formulating the request messages according to the rules of the XML schema that can be submitted to the web service

▪ Use these requests to include malicious contents in SOAP requests and analyze errors to gain a deeper understanding of potential security weaknesses
