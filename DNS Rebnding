Attackers use the DNS rebinding technique to bypass the same-origin policy’s security constraints, allowing the malicious web page to communicate with or make arbitrary requests to local domains. 

For instance, if a client is working for an organization, he/she mostly uses the internal or private network. 

Any externals resources cannot be accessed inside that private network due to the same-origin policy (SOP). 

Hence, attackers cannot directly communicate with the local network due to restrictions in the SOP.

An attacker creates a malicious website with the domain name certifiedhacker.com and registers it with the DNS server controlled by him/her. 

Now, the attacker configures the DNS server to send DNS responses with very short TTL values to avoid caching of the responses. 

Then, the attacker begins his/her intended operation with the HTTP server that contains the malicious website http://certifiedhacker.com. 

Then, the JavaScript code accesses the website on the domain http://certifiedhacker.com to get additional resources from http://certifiedhacker.com/secret.html. 

When the browser runs the JavaScript, it makes a DNS request for the domain (owing to the short TTL configuration), but the attacker-controlled DNS server responds with a new IP.

For instance, if the attacker-controlled DNS server responds with the private or internal IP of xyz.com, the victim’s browser loads http://xyz.com/secret.html and not http://certifiedhacker.com/secret.html successfully by bypassing the SOP
