SQL injection attacks use a series of malicious SQL queries or SQL statements to directly manipulate the database. 

Applications often use SQL statements to authenticate users, validate roles and access levels, store and retrieve information for the application and user, and link to other data sources. 

SQL injection attacks work because the application does not properly validate the input before passing it to an SQL statement

The expression “OR 1=1” evaluates to the value “TRUE,” often allowing the enumeration of all user ID values from the database.

An attacker uses a vulnerable web application to bypass normal security measures and obtain direct access to valuable data. 

Attackers carry out SQL injection attacks from the web browser’s address bar, form fields, queries, searches, and so on. SQL injection attacks allow attackers 

Log into the application without supplying valid credentials 

Perform queries against data in the database, often even data to which the application would not normally have access

Use the trust relationships established between the web application components to access other databases
