Access control refers to how a web application grants access to create, update, and delete any record/content or function to some privileged users while restricting access to other users.

Broken access control is a method by which an attacker identifies a flaw related to access control, bypasses the authentication, and then compromises the network

They allow attackers to act as users or administrators with privileged functions and create, access, update, or delete any record.

Evading the filtering of access controls by changing the URL, API request, an HTML page, or the application state via parameter tampering, force browsing, or any attacking tool 

Manipulating the metadata; for example, the manipulation of a hidden field or alteration of a JSON Web Token (JWT) access-control token or a cookie for exploiting JWT invalidation or elevating privileges

Force browsing to privileged or authentic pages as a valid or an invalid user, respectively
