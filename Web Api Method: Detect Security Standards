APIs such as SOAP and REST implement different authentication/authorization standards such as OpenID Connect, SAML, OAuth 1.X and 2.X, and WS-Security

SSL provides transport-level security for API messages to ensure confidentiality through encryption and integrity through signature

In most of the APIs, SSL is used to encrypt only sensitive user data such as credit card details, thereby leaving other information in plaintext

If these security standards are configured improperly, an attacker can identify vulnerabilities in these standards for further exploitation

 SSL provides transport-level security for API messages to ensure confidentiality through encryption and integrity through signature. 

Although SSL is used for security, in most API messages, only sensitive user data such as credit card details are encrypted, leaving other information in plaintext.


Kiterunner is an advanced tool designed for API scanning and contextual content discovery,

specifically tailored for modern web applications that heavily rely on APIs. 

It outshines conventional tools by not just brute-forcing directories but also by discovering and understanding complex API endpoint structures through context-aware scanning.

The tool assists attackers in scanning the API endpoints; it can scan single targets, multiple targets, and lists of all targets at once
